As developers, we often hear the terms concurrency and parallelism thrown around like they’re interchangeable. But did you know they represent two distinct concepts in computing? Understanding the difference can help you write more efficient and scalable software.

⚡ 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒚 – Handling Multiple Tasks at Once (But Not Simultaneously)
Concurrency is all about dealing with multiple things at th	e same time, not necessarily doing them at the same time.
Think of it like a single chef preparing multiple dishes. The chef switches between tasks — chopping vegetables, boiling water, baking a cake — all without finishing one before starting another. It’s about managing tasks and context switching.
📌 In programming, concurrency allows systems to stay responsive, even when handling multiple tasks, by interleaving execution.
⚡ 𝑷𝒂𝒓𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒔𝒎 – Doing Multiple Tasks at the Same Time
Parallelism is about doing multiple things simultaneously. Imagine multiple chefs in the kitchen, each working on a separate dish at the same time — faster and more efficient!
📌 In code, this means splitting a task into subtasks and executing them at the same time, often on multiple processors or cores.
